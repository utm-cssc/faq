When are the maximum cut-offs for POSt going to be posted? | As of right now, we are not sure when the maximums will be set due to multiple factors (e.g. COVID, new administration, etc.) The official cut-offs themselves are projected to be set in later May 2020. (Nov. 2020)
Will there be a huge increase in POSt requirements this year? | The department is unsure since there seems to be a decrease in student enrollment this year coupled with other factors. Though, they suspect it won't go up by a lot.
How many first year courses are we allowed to take? | Prior to September 2020, 6.0 credits for 100-level courses would count towards your degree. But currently, you can check how many 100-level courses count towards your degree and other specifications through the Degree Explorer tool accessible through ACORN under "Academics" > "Planning Tools".
